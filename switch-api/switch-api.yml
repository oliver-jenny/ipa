  title: AXA Health Switch API
  version: '0.3'
  description: |
    A draft for an API that allows basic insurance providers to pull information from AXA's Switching Service.

    The intent of this API is to replace or at least complement the current way of communication between AXA and
    basic insurance providers in regards to basic insurance changes.

    Currently, information about registrations and cancellation of AXA customers with
    basic insurance providers is sent via emails containing registration/cancellation PDF documents and the
    mandate document to prove AXA's right to act in the name of the customer.
    These emails are processed manually by the basic insurance providers and hopefully end in a successful cancellation
    of insurance coverage in the case of cancellation and in a insurance policy in case of a registration.
    The main issues with the current process are:

    - Unclear and inefficient handling of error cases and handling differs between the different basic insurance providers.
    - Email does not guarantee delivery
    - Emails are not encrypted
    - Feedback for processed changes needs to be handled manually
    - Manual processing of registration & cancellation for the basic insurance providers

    The API tries to address the first four issues and at the same time provide the opportunity to automate processing on the basic
    insurance providers side.
